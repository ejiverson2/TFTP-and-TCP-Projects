# TFTP-and-TCP-Projects
A small collection of UDP projects.
### Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
A simplistic method for sending and verifying files over UDP.
### Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
A much more complex way of sending information that involves establishing connections using a three-way handshake. A sliding window allows multiple packets to be sent at once. Finally, terminating connections involves more hand-shaking.
